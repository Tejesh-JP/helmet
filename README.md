Ensuring safety in high-risk environments, such as construction sites, industrial
areas, and sports arenas, is of paramount importance. One crucial aspect is the
proper usage of safety helmets to protect individuals from potential head
injuries. This paper presents a novel approach for helmet detection utilizing
YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) object detection framework in combination
with TensorFlow, a popular deep learning library. The proposed system aims to
automatically detect the presence of safety helmets in real-time video streams
or images, enabling prompt intervention or alerting authorities in case of
non-compliance. The implementation involves training the YOLOv7 model on
a large annotated dataset of helmet images, encompassing diverse perspectives,
lighting conditions, and helmet types. TensorFlow is utilized as the underlying
deep learning framework to train the model, optimize network parameters, and
fine-tune the performance. Quantitative metrics, such as precision, recall, and
mean average precision (mAP), are utilized to gauge the performance of the
proposed helmet detection system. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed YOLOv7-based approach achieves high accuracy and real-time
performance, making it suitable for practical applications. The system exhibits
robustness against challenging scenarios, including occlusions, varying helmet
colors, and cluttered backgrounds. Overall, this research contributes to
enhancing safety measures in high-risk environments by automating the
detection of safety helmet usage. The proposed YOLOv7 and
TensorFlow-based framework offers a reliable and scalable solution that can be
extended to various industries, contributing to accident prevention and
promoting a culture of safety in workplaces and recreational activities.
